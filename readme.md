# A classic forum system with next-gen.
[Mention](https://mentionbb.com/community) is an advanced forum community software. It is based on the balance between the classic forum software and the new generation ones. In this context, it has made it essential to add revolutionary innovations with developing technologies.
- **Flexible and fast.** Despite using advanced algorithms, Mention is a very lightweight software thanks to its caching technologies. On the other hand, it contains highly complex and previously unseen components.

- **Addons and modular support.** Mention uses a unique plugin system. There is a system where you can add an add-on to almost every part of it without difficulty. Plugin system works via HTML/CSS marker. In addition, with its advanced infrastructure and modular structure, you will never have any difficulties in your projects. Want a Portal? You can add. Blog? You can add.

- **Languages!** It was developed for you to adapt it to absolutely any language you want. Adding language is easy and simple, language files are very simple and you can also convert them to any sentence from the admin panel.

- **It's a nice theme but you can change it.** The default theme is responsive and built with many new technologies, but you can customize this theme or replace it completely.

- **Advanced template system.** Mention uses an improved Twig 3.0 engine. You can use this engine in plugins and various everywhere. There is quite a detailed area for editing templates in the admin panel.

And much much more.
